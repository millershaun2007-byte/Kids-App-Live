                    As a parent, I know that navigating the digital world is one of our biggest challenges. We worry about screen time, but we also see how technology can be an amazing tool for learning and creativity. This app was built to be an ally for families. This section is here to offer some gentle guidance and support, based on my own experiences and research.

                <h3 style="color: #764ba2;">Understanding Neurodiversity</h3>
                <p><strong>Neurodiversity</strong> means that everyone’s brain is unique. Some people think, learn, or experience the world differently—and that’s a good thing! Neurodivergent kids might have ADHD, autism, dyslexia, or other ways of thinking. These differences bring creativity, new ideas, and special talents to our world.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #0288D1; margin-top: 18px;">Where Can Kids Go for Support?</h4>
                <ul style="margin-bottom: 18px;">
                    <li><strong>Trusted Adults:</strong> Talk to a parent, teacher, school counselor, or family member if you need help or just want to share how you feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clubs & Groups:</strong> Join after-school clubs, art/music groups, or sports teams to make friends and try new things.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Centers & Libraries:</strong> Many offer programs, quiet spaces, and fun activities for all kids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Online Communities:</strong> (With adult supervision) There are safe online spaces for kids to connect and share their interests.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>It’s okay to feel all kinds of emotions—happy, sad, excited, worried, or mad.</li>
                    <li>Try using “I feel…” sentences to share your feelings (like “I feel proud when I finish a drawing” or “I feel nervous before a test”).</li>

                    <li>Ask for a hug, a break, or help if you need it.</li>

                <h3>A New Way to Think About Screen Time: Quality Over Quantity</h3>
                <p>
                    The conversation around screen time often focuses on one thing: the clock. While time limits are important (and we're building tools to help with that!), a more helpful approach is to focus on the **quality** of the screen time.
                </p>
                <p>Ask yourself these questions about your child's digital activities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Is it Creative?</strong> Does it allow them to make, design, or build something new?</li>
                    <li><strong>Is it Active?</strong> Does it engage their mind with problem-solving or critical thinking?</li>
                    <li><strong>Is it Connecting?</strong> Does it help them connect with family or friends in a positive way?</li>
                    <li><strong>Is it Calming?</strong> Does it help them regulate their emotions when they feel overwhelmed?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If the answer to these is yes, then that screen time is valuable. This app is designed to hit all of these points, providing a high-quality digital experience you can feel good about.

                <h3>Building Healthy Digital Routines</h3>
                <p>
                    Routines help children feel safe and secure, and digital habits are no different. Integrating screen time into a predictable daily flow can prevent many of the usual struggles.
                </p>
                <h4>Tips for a Healthy Routine:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Create "Screen-Free" Zones & Times:</strong> The dinner table and bedrooms are great places to make screen-free. It's also helpful to have a "no screens" rule for the first hour of the morning and the last hour before bed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Balance is Key:</strong> For every period of screen time, try to have a period of "green time" (playing outside), "face time" (connecting with family), or "down time" (quiet, non-digital play).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use a Visual Timer:</strong> For many kids, especially neurodivergent ones, seeing how much time is left is less stressful than a sudden "time's up!" A visual timer can help them prepare for the transition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Plan the Transition:</strong> Give gentle warnings. "In 10 minutes, we'll be saving our creations and turning off the tablet for dinner." This respects their engagement and helps avoid meltdowns.
                    </li>
                </ol>
